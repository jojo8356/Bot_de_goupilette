# Readme - Discord Bot with Reaction Roles

This Python script implements a Discord bot using the discord.py library to manage reaction roles on a specific channel. The bot allows users to add or remove roles by reacting to certain emojis associated with each role.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- discord.py library

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Install the required library using pip:
```bash
pip install discord.py
```

## Usage

1. Replace "APIKEY" in the script with your actual Discord bot token.
2. Run the Python script (filename.py) to start the bot.
3. The bot will sync with the Discord server and set up reaction roles for specific emojis in the target channel.
4. Users can react to the messages with the emojis to add or remove roles associated with each emoji.

## How It Works

1. The bot listens for specific events like on_ready, on_member_join, on_reaction_add, and on_reaction_remove.
2. On on_ready, the bot synchronizes with the server and sets up the reaction roles by sending a message with the available roles and their associated emojis.
3. When a user joins the server (on_member_join), the bot sends a welcome message to a specific channel.
4. When a user reacts to a message with one of the specified emojis (on_reaction_add), the bot adds the corresponding role to the user.
5. If a user removes their reaction from a message (on_reaction_remove), the bot removes the associated role from the user.
